# Data Privacy Impact Assessment (DPIA) Automation

This Python script provides core functionalities for automating the DPIA process, including identifying privacy risks associated with data processing activities, assessing their impact, suggesting mitigation strategies, and generating a detailed DPIA report.

## Overview

The script consists of two main classes:

### 1. `ProcessingActivity`

Represents a data processing activity for DPIA.

Attributes:
- `name`: Name of the activity.
- `description`: Description of the activity.
- `data_types`: List of data types processed.
- `purposes`: List of data processing purposes.

### 2. `DPIA`

Core functionalities for automating the DPIA process.

Methods:
- `add_activity(activity)`: Adds a data processing activity to the DPIA.
- `identify_risks(activity)`: Identifies potential privacy risks associated with an activity.
- `assess_impact(risk)`: Assesses the impact of a privacy risk.
- `suggest_mitigation(risk)`: Suggests mitigation strategies to address privacy risks.
- `generate_report()`: Generates a detailed DPIA report.

## Example

The script includes a sample usage in the `main()` function:

1. Create a DPIA instance.
2. Add a processing activity.
3. Analyze risks, assess impact, and suggest mitigation.
4. Generate a DPIA report.

## Customization

- You can customize the `ProcessingActivity` attributes to fit your specific data processing activities.
- Implement actual logic for identifying risks, assessing impact, suggesting mitigations, and generating reports in the respective methods of the `DPIA` class.

## Note

- This script includes placeholder logic for risk assessment, impact assessment, mitigation suggestions, and report generation. You should replace these with actual implementation based on your requirements and privacy regulations.
